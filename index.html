    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Movie Recommendation System: A recommendation system's purpose
      is to search for content that would be interesting to an individual. Recommendation systems are AI-based
      algorithms that skim through all possible
      options and create a customized list of items that are interesting and relevant
      to an individual. These results are based on their profile, search/browsing
      history, what other people with similar traits/demographics are watching,
      and how likely you are to watch those movies.</p>

  <div id="abstract-container" class="abstract-container">
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>In this Project, we have implemented a Movie Recommendation System using different models which are KNN,
      Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, SVM and Random Forest. There are two types of recommendation systems,
      Collaborative and
      Item based. We have implemented Item Based Recommendation System using KNN and for Collaborative System we have
      implemented rest others. For this project, we have used data provided from kggle and used web scraping to collect
      posters and others details.

    <h2>Thought Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The project aims to develop a recommender system for this (MOVIE)
      </li>
      <li>Broadly classifying there are two types of recommender systems :</li>
      <img src="image1.png">
      <li>Content based Filtering : In this the model tries to recommend the
        user based on his past queries, viewed movies, movies which he liked,
        browsing history and the suggest a movie which is similar to those
        features</li>
      <li>Collaborative Filtering : In this we try to find similar unrelated
        users and and as they are have same interest what ever a user views it
        will be recommended to the other user</li>
      <li>Hybrid : Content based Filtering + Collaborative Filtering</li>
      <li>So it was decided that we would be using a hybrid model based on given task</li>

    <h2>Data Visualization and Info</h2>
    <p>The Data we have use has been taken from kaggel and it contains csv files through which we get the datas
      containing the informations: userID, movieID, tags, ratings, genre etc. and further we did web scraping in order
      to get the details such as Directors, Casts, Descriptions etc.

    <div class="Naive-Bayes-container" onclick="openKNNMain()">
      <h3>KNN Model</h3>
      <p>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for
        classification
        and regression tasks. The principle behind KNN is intuitive: it classifies or predicts a new data point's label
        or value based on its proximity to existing data points in the feature space. In classification, ...</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Naive-Bayes-container" onclick="openNaiveMain()">
      <h3>Naive Bayes Model</h3>
      <p>Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, with the "naive" assumption of feature
        independence.
        It's efficient, easy to implement, and works well with high-dimensional data. Despite its simplicity, Naive
        Bayes
        often performs surprisingly well in practice, making it popular for text classification ...</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Naive-Bayes-container" onclick="openLinRegMain()">
      <h3>Linear Regression Model</h3>
      <p>Linear Regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by
        fitting a straight line to the data. It seeks to minimize the difference between observed and predicted values,
        estimating coefficients for the line to best represent the data's linear trend. This method is ...</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Naive-Bayes-container" onclick="openRandomMain()">
      <h3>Random Forest Model</h3>
      <p>Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees during training and merges
        their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Each tree in the forest is built using a random
        subset of features and a random subset of the training data. Predictions are made by averaging or voting ...</p>

      <h3>SVM Model</h3>
      <p>Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and
        regression tasks. It finds the optimal hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that best separates data points
        of different classes. SVM aims to maximize the margin between classes, making it robust to outliers ...</p>
